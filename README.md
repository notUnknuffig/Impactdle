The Website aims to recreate a wordle like game, but with Genshin Impact Characters. 
I plan to add more Characters in the Future.
It uses a JSON-File as a Database, because I don't know how to create a Databank :(
All assets used are directly from the Game. I don't stand in any connection with Hoyoverse.
