<h1>Impactdle</h1>
The Website aims to recreate a wordle like game, but with Genshin Impact Characters. There are currently three game modes: <h3>Characters</h3>
The Goal is to Guess the name of a randomly selected character with as little attempts as possible. 
Every time you guess a character, aspects like: Element, path type etc. are shown. 
If an aspect is the same for the selected character and the guessed character it is marked as correct. 
<h3>Ability</h3>
The name of an ability is shown, and the player must guess the character that this ability belongs to.
After 3 guesses the element of the character is revealed. 
After 6 guesses the Icon of the ability is revealed.
<h3>Splash Arts</h3>
At the beginning the player is shown a small cutout of a character’s splash art. The goal is again to guess the name of the character. After every incorrect guess the cutout gets bigger.

I was inspired by a game called <a href="https://loldle.net/">Loldle</a>, which is similar game for League of Legends Characters. I plan to add more Characters in the Future.
It uses a JSON-File as a Database, because I don't know how to create a Databank :(<br><br>
All assets used are directly from the Game. I don't stand in any connection with Hoyoverse.
